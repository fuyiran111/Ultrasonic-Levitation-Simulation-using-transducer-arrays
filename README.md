# Ultrasonic-Levitation-Simulation-using-transducer-arrays
Abstractâ€” Making things float without any support point is very technical in normal life. The project is called Ultrasonic Levitation using transducer arrays. Here we use an economical method to raise transducer arrays to make the object floating and moving. Because the levitation field is invisible in the research, this report will consider what is its total field like by using MATLAB and what happens to the total field if move the object, and how the field looks like when place two opposing transducer arrays to interference each other.
